# Personal website of Okko Makkonen

Personal website at [okkomakkonen.fi](https://okkomakkonen.fi) hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Testing locally

A simple http server can be started with

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

The website can then be accessed on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## LaTeX support

Added an article with some LaTeX math. Seems to work pretty nicely.

## TODO

- Change Google Fonts to locally hosted font
