This is a written form of a talk in the ANTA seminar.
The complexity of matrix multiplication represents the number of
operations needed to compute a matrix product in the asymptotic limit.
The first advance in asymptotic complexity was made in 1969 when
Strassen introduced an algorithm that is capable of computing the
product of two <span class="math inline">\(N \times N\)</span> matrices
with <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(N^{2.81})\)</span>
operations, which is better than the naive algorithm that takes <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(N^3)\)</span> operations. The current
record is an algorithm that is able to compute the product using just
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(N^{2.372})\)</span> operations.
We present the basic tools that are used to analyze this problem and
present an algorithm that is even better than the Strassen algorithm.
This includes studying the matrix multiplication tensor, its rank, and
the so-called border rank.</div><div><a href=/articles/website-hosting><h2>Website Hosting</h2></a><strong>December 12, 2022</strong><p class=abstract><strong>Abstract.</strong>
My website started in March 2022, since I wanted a public place to showcase my research. There
are countless ways to host a website nowadays, but here is the minimal system I decided on. The
site is hosted for free on GitHub Pages.</div></section></div></div>
