            <strong>Abstract.</strong>
            My website started in March 2022, since I wanted a public place to showcase my research. There are countless
            ways to host a website nowadays, but here is the minimal system I decided on. The site is hosted for free on
            GitHub Pages.
        </p>
    </header>
    <p>
        The intention of this website was to keep it minimal, following the inspiration of <a
            href="https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site</a>. I started with just the <a href="/">main
            page</a>, so I did not want to use some heavy frameworks to build a simple website, since I want to be able
        to maintain this myself even in the future. Additionally, I wanted to keep this lightweight and cheap. Websites
        nowadays are large and complicated, but they do not need to be. I ended up with the following choice. This
        website consists of handmade HTML and CSS, which are managed on git and hosted <a
            href="https://github.com/okkomakkonen/okkomakkonen.fi">on GitHub</a>. The static website is hosted on GitHub
        Pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        As my goal was to keep the site minimal, both in design and complexity, I decided against building a website
        with a static site generator like Jekyll. Such generators are great tools for building all kinds of websites,
        but they require some knowledge of a particular system. The advantage of writing pure HTML by hand is that
        everything is right there. I can tweak every aspect of the site without worrying about reading the documentation
        of the static site generator. Of course some aspects of designing the website are more difficult by hand, but I
        like that it forces me to design a simple site. I can also guarantee that the file sizes are small. For example,
        the main page is just over 2kB after minification (without the image).
    </p>

    <p>
        As I mentioned, the source code of this website is publically available on GitHub. Git is clearly the best way
        to store source code, so it was an obvious choice for me, since I wanted version control and cloud backups of my
        progress. I also utilize GitHub actions to automatically minify the source files on each push. The minified
        files are stored on the gh-pages branch which is used to deploy the site using <a
            href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. Setting up the GitHub Pages was very simple and I even
        got my own domain name running in a matter of minutes. Even setting up HTTPS was easy.
    </p>

    <p>
        For local development I use the simple webserver in python, which I deploy using <a
            href="https://taskfile.dev/">Task</a> (I can highly recommend this as a substitute for Make). Additionally,
        I used <a href="https://realfavicongenerator.net/">RealFaviconGenerator</a> to generate the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">favicon</a> for my site. I try to follow the best practices for
        webdesign and typography whenever possible, so if you have any suggestions that would improve my site, please
        let me know.
