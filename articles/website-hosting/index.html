            <strong>Abstract.</strong>
            My website started in March 2022, since I wanted a public place to showcase my research. There are countless
            ways to host a website nowadays, but here is the system I decided on.
        </p>

    <p>
        The intention of this website was to keep it minimal. I do not want to use some heavy frameworks to build a
        simple website, since I want to be able to maintain this myself even in the future. Additionally, I wanted to
        keep this lightweight and cheap. I ended up with the following choice. This website consists of handmade HTML
        and CSS, which are managed on git and hosted <a href="https://github.com/okkomakkonen/okkomakkonen.fi">on
            GitHub</a>. The static website is hosted on GitHub pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        As my goal was to keep the site minimal, both in design and complexity, I decided against building a website
        with a static site generator like Jekyll. Such generators are great tools for building all kinds of websites,
        but they require some knowledge of a particular system. The advantage of writing pure HTML by hand is that
        everything is right there. I can tweak every aspect of the site without worrying about reading the documentation
        of the static site generator. Of course some aspects of designing the website are more difficult by hand, but I
        like that it forces me to design a simple site. I can also guarantee that the file sizes are small. For example,
        the main page is just over 2kB after minification without the image.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I mentioned, the source code of this website is publically available on GitHub. Git is clearly the best way
        to store source code, so it was an obvious choice for me, since I wanted version control and cloud backups of my
        progress. I also utilize GitHub actions to automatically minify the source files on each push. The minified
        files are stored on the gh-pages branch which is used to deploy the site using GitHub pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        For local development I use the simple webserver in python, which I deploy using Task.
